= Embedding Documents and Creating a Chatbot
:description: Learn how to embed documents and create a chatbot using LangChain4J in Quarkus.

:project-ai-name: quarkus-langchain4j-app

Many applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) often require user-specific data beyond their training set, such as CSV files, data from various sources, or reports. To achieve this, the process of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is commonly employed.
Through this technique, you can combine your own business data (or whatever data!) with the LLM to enrich the possibilities offered by your application.

In this section we're going to add business logic for a fictional car rental service which has a terms and conditions
document that outlines how long in advance cancellations are allowed.
We're going to embed this business document for the LLM, which will use it to determine business rules accordingly.


== Add the Websockets and Context Propagation extensions

Open a new terminal window, and make sure you’re at the root of your `{project-ai-name}` project, then run:

[tabs]
====
Maven::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -D"extensions=websockets-next,quarkus-langchain4j-easy-rag"
----

--
Quarkus CLI::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus extension add websockets-next langchain4j-easy-rag

== Adding temperature property to your configuration

Add the following properties to your `application.properties` so that it looks like:

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Set OpenAI key if you want to use the API key
# quarkus.langchain4j.openai.api-key=demo

# With Ollama
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.base-url=http://localhost:11434/v1
# Configure server to use a specific model
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.chat-model.model-name=granite3.1-dense:2b
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.embedding-model.model-name=granite3.1-dense:2b

quarkus.langchain4j.openai.log-requests=true
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.log-responses=true
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.timeout=60s

%dev.quarkus.mailer.mock=false

quarkus.langchain4j.openai.chat-model.temperature=0.0 
quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path=src/main/resources/catalog

booking.daystostart=1#<3>
booking.daystoend=3
booking.firstname=john
booking.lastname=doe
booking.number=123-456

quarkus.langchain4j.openai.chat-model.model-name=gpt-4o #<4>
----
<1> The "temperature" parameter in AI language models controls the randomness of text generation. Lower values result in more predictable outputs, while higher values encourage creativity and diversity in responses.
<2> Path to where documents are stored for the Retrieval Augmentation Generation (ie. the documents the AI model will use to build local knowledge)
<3> Sample booking data
<4> The specific model to use. IMPORTANT: gpt3.5-turbo is much cheaper but the results will be slower and less reliable.


== Embedding the business document

NOTE: If you don't provide a model that supports embeddings and tools you will still be able to go through this exercise but the "Tools" functions won't be called, resulting in unexpected answers. See the previous "Agents and Tools" chapter for more information.

Let's provide a document containing the service's terms of use:

Create a new folder in `src/main/resources/catalog` and add a new file named `miles-of-smiles-terms-of-use.txt` in this folder.
Then add the following content to it:

[.console-input]
[source,text]

----

NOTE: Notice in the above document that the rules state it is not allowed to cancel a booking within 7 days prior to the start of the booking.

Remember how we set the `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path` in the application.properties file? It points to this same directory,
and thanks to the langchain4j-easy-rag extension any document in this folder will be scanned and added to the context of the LLM.


== Create the Booking structure

Create a new `Customer` Java record in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

public record Customer(String name, String surname) {
}
----

Now we create a Booking record as well.

Create a new `Booking` Java record in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import java.time.LocalDate;

public record Booking(String bookingNumber, LocalDate bookingFrom, LocalDate bookingTo, Customer customer) {
}
----

== Create the Booking functionality

Let's create a simplified Booking service for the LLM to call:

Create a new `BookingService` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.Map;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

@ApplicationScoped
public class BookingService {

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "booking") #<1>
    Map<String, String> booking;

    public Booking getBookingDetails(String bookingNumber, String customerName, String customerSurname) {
        ensureExists(bookingNumber, customerName, customerSurname);
        LocalDate bookingFrom = LocalDate.now().plusDays(Long.parseLong(booking.get("daystostart")));
        LocalDate bookingTo = LocalDate.now().plusDays(Long.parseLong(booking.get("daystoend")));
        // Retrieval from DB mocking
        Customer customer = new Customer(customerName, customerSurname);
        return new Booking(bookingNumber, bookingFrom, bookingTo, customer);
    }

    public void cancelBooking(String bookingNumber, String customerName, String customerSurname) {
        ensureExists(bookingNumber, customerName, customerSurname);

        // TODO add logic to double check booking conditions in case the LLM got it
        // wrong.
        // throw new BookingCannotBeCancelledException(bookingNumber);
    }

    private void ensureExists(String bookingNumber, String customerName, String customerSurname) {
        // Check mocking
        if (!(bookingNumber.equals(booking.get("number"))
                && customerName.toLowerCase().equals(booking.get("firstname"))
                && customerSurname.toLowerCase().equals(booking.get("lastname")))) {
            throw new BookingNotFoundException(bookingNumber);
        }
    }
}

class BookingNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {

    public BookingNotFoundException(String bookingNumber) {
        super("Booking " + bookingNumber + " not found");
    }
}

class BookingCannotBeCancelledException extends RuntimeException {

    public BookingCannotBeCancelledException(String bookingNumber) {
        super("Booking " + bookingNumber + " cannot be canceled");
    }
}
----
<1> Retrieve a single booking from the application.properties file. (in the real world this data would likely come from a DB instead :) )

Now we define a `BookingTools` singleton that will serve our AI with proper tools.

Create a new `BookingTools` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import jakarta.inject.Singleton;

import dev.langchain4j.agent.tool.Tool;

@Singleton
public class BookingTools {

    private final BookingService bookingService;

    public BookingTools(BookingService bookingService) {
        this.bookingService = bookingService;
    }

    @Tool
    public Booking getBookingDetails(String bookingNumber, String customerName, String customerSurname) {
        return bookingService.getBookingDetails(bookingNumber, customerName, customerSurname);
    }

    @Tool
    public void cancelBooking(String bookingNumber, String customerName, String customerSurname) {
        bookingService.cancelBooking(bookingNumber, customerName, customerSurname);
    }
}
----


== Create the customer support service

Now we create the whole structure for our AI-based customer service.

Create a new `AssistantForCustomerSupport` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import dev.langchain4j.service.SystemMessage;
import dev.langchain4j.service.UserMessage;
import io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.RegisterAiService;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.SessionScoped;

@RegisterAiService(tools = BookingTools.class)
@SessionScoped
public interface AssistantForCustomerSupport {

    @SystemMessage({
            "You are a customer support agent of a car rental company named 'Miles of Smiles'.",
            "Before providing information about booking or cancelling booking, you MUST always check:",
            "booking number, customer name and surname and the Cancellation policy in the Terms of Use",
            "Before cancelling, confirm with the customer that they want to proceed",
            "Do NOT cancel the booking if the start date is not compliant with the Cancellation policy in the Terms of Use",
            "Today is {current_date}."
    })
    String chat(@UserMessage String userMessage);
}
----

And finally our chat implementation that will do the whole thing.

Create a new `ChatSocket` Java record in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnOpen;
import io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnTextMessage;
import io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocket;

@WebSocket(path = "/chat")
public class ChatSocket {

    private final AssistantForCustomerSupport assistant;

    public ChatSocket(AssistantForCustomerSupport assistant) {
        this.assistant = assistant;
    }

    @OnOpen
    public String onOpen() {
        return "Hello from Miles of Smiles, how can we help you?";
    }

    @OnTextMessage
    public String onMessage(String userMessage) {
        return assistant.chat(userMessage);
    }
}
----

== Create the chat frontend

Finally, let's add our chat frontend.

Create a new `chat-assistant.html` file in `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,html]
----

    </script>
</body>

</html>

== Invoke the endpoint

You can check your prompt implementation by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/chat-assistant.html[window=_blank]

Try cancelling a booking for booking number `123-456` with name `John Doe`. If everything goes well, the booking should be rejected,
since we have specified the start date to be in 1 day.

An example of output (can vary on each prompt execution):

image::chat-assistant-cancelled.png[]

Now change the value of `booking.daystostart` in your application.properties to > 7 and refresh the browser window.
Try cancelling again, and you should see that this time we are allowed to cancel the reservation.

image::chat-assistant-success.png[]

For an extra challenge, feel free to play around with the `SystemMessage` in `AssistantForCustomerSupport.java`,
or perhaps change the `BookingService.java` to call a database that contains customer and booking information.
And see if bookings effectively get cancelled or not :)
