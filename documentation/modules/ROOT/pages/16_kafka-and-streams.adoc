= Apache Kafka with Reactive Streams

Mutiny is just part of the Reactive story. To complement it, we need Reactive Streams too. And an important service that can serve as the underlying implementation for our stream is http://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka,window=_blank].

In this chapter, we'll do a small change, we send beers with a price to a Kafka broker instead of using a memory channel.

== Add the Reactive Messaging Kafka extension

Just open a new terminal window, and make sure youâ€™re at the root of your `{project-name}` project, then run:

[tabs]
====
Maven::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=messaging-kafka
----

--
Quarkus CLI::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus extension add messaging-kafka
----
--
====

== Modify BeerProcessor

In the `BeerProcessor` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `org.acme` package should have the `print` method commented as it's not necessary anymore because the content of the `messages` channel will be send to a Kafka topic:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
/**@Incoming("messages")
public void print(JsonObject beer) {
    System.out.println(JsonbBuilder.create().toJson(beer));
}**/
----

== Add the Reactive Messaging Kafka properties

Add the following properties to your `application.properties` in `src/main/resources` to configure `messages` channel to be backed by a Kafka topic instead of a memory channel:

[.console-input]
[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.messages.connector=smallrye-kafka // <1>
mp.messaging.outgoing.messages.topic=pricedbeers // <2>
----
<1> `messages` channel is backed to Kafka
<2> `messages` channel sends events to `pricedbeers` topic

TIP: If all channels are backed to Kafka, it's not necessary to set the `connector` property.

TIP: If the channel name is the same as the topic, it's not necessary to set the `topic` property.

== Dev Services for Kafka

Because starting a Kafka broker can be long and you need to develop fast in your local environment, Dev Services for Kafka is here to help you!

Since `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka` extension is present, Dev Services for Kafka automatically starts a Kafka broker in dev mode and when running tests.

TIP: You can disable Dev Services for Kafka by adding `quarkus.kafka.devservices.enabled=false` or configuring `kafka.bootstrap.servers` in `application.properties`.

== Invoke the endpoint

With all these changes done, having Docker/Podman running in your computer, and starting the service in dev mode, you can send the same request as in the previous chapter:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl -w '\n' localhost:8080/beer/emit/1
----


Now, nothing is shown as return or in the Quarkus terminal, because the event is sent to a Kafka topic.

To check the content of the topic, we can use the Dev UI interfac by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/io.quarkus.quarkus-kafka-client/topics[window=_blank]
