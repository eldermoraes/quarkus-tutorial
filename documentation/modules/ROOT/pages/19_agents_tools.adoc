= Agents/Tools

:project-ai-name: quarkus-langchain4j-app

Things become more interesting when you can bring the AI LLM into your application and get it to interact with specific functions you build for it.

This section will use AI to trigger an email service from our local application. To do this, we'll use LangChain4j's concept of Agents and Tools.

Agents operate by utilizing a language model to decipher a series of actions, unlike chains where actions are pre-programmed. Ie. agents leverage a language model as a cognitive engine to decide on the actions (tools) and their order.

You can read more about this in the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-langchain4j/dev/agent-and-tools.html[Quarkus LangChain4j Documentation]

== Add the Mailer and Mailpit extensions

Open a new terminal window, and make sure youâ€™re at the root of your `{project-ai-name}` project, then run the following command to add emailing capabilities to our application:

[tabs]
====
Maven::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -D"extensions=mailpit,mailer"
----

--
Quarkus CLI::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus extension add mailpit mailer
----
--
====

== Create the email service

Let's create a class for our email service.

Create a new `EmailService` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import dev.langchain4j.agent.tool.Tool;
import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import io.quarkus.mailer.Mail;
import io.quarkus.mailer.Mailer;

@ApplicationScoped
public class EmailService {

    @Inject
    Mailer mailer;

    @Tool("send the given content by email")
    public void sendAnEmail(String content) {
        Log.info("Sending an email: " + content);
        mailer.send(Mail
            .withText("sendMeALetter@quarkus.io", "A poem for you", content)
            .setFrom("origin@quarkus.io"));
    }

}
----


== Create the AI service with prompt context

Let's create an interface for our AI service, but with `SystemMessage` and `UserMessage` this time.
`SystemMessage` gives context to the AI Model.
In this case, we tell it that it should craft a message as if it is written by a professional poet.
The `UserMessage` is the actual instruction/question we're sending to the AI model.
As you can see in the example below,
you can format and parameterize the `UserMessage`, translating structured content to text and vice-versa.

Create a new `AssistantWithContext` Java interface in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import dev.langchain4j.service.SystemMessage;
import dev.langchain4j.service.UserMessage;
import io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.RegisterAiService;

@RegisterAiService(tools = EmailService.class)
public interface AssistantWithContext {

    /**
     * Ask the LLM to create a poem about the given topic.
     *
     * @param topic the topic of the poem
     * @param lines the number of line of the poem
     * @return the poem
     */
    @SystemMessage("You are a professional poet")
    @UserMessage("Write a poem about {topic}. The poem should be {lines} lines long. Then send this poem by email.")
    String writeAPoem(String topic, int lines);

}
----

Note that this assistant references the email service as a tool.

== Create a email sending resource

Now we create a resource that builds the interaction and calls the service with the required parameters (topic and number of lines).

Create a new `EmailMeAPoemResource` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

@Path("/email-me-a-poem")
public class EmailMeAPoemResource {

    private final AssistantWithContext service;

    public EmailMeAPoemResource(AssistantWithContext service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    @GET
    public String emailMeAPoem() {
        return service.writeAPoem("Quarkus", 4);
    }

}
----

== Modify application.properties to use the email Tools

Tool calling is not supported with the OpenAI `demo` key so we will need to
either use a real API key, or use a local model that supports tools..
If you want to use OpenAI's ChatGPT, you can create and fund an account at https://platform.openai.com/[OpenAI] and then set the openai-api-key to your key.

We will use a local (free) open source model served with Ollama instead. 
To do this, you will need to https://ollama.com/download[download and install Ollama].
Once that's done, you will need to https://ollama.com/search?c=tools[download a model that supports tool calling], such as `granite3.1-dense:2b`. To do so, execute the command:

[#quarkuspdb-dl-ollama]
[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ollama pull granite3.1-dense:2b
----

Update the following properties in your `application.properties`

NOTE: If you do not want to go through the trouble of creating an OpenAI account or install Ollama, you can still test the below scenario, it just won't send an email since the "Tool" functionality unfortunately won't work.

Modify the application.properties as below: 

[#quarkuspdb-update-props]
[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Set OpenAI key if you want to use the API key
# quarkus.langchain4j.openai.api-key=demo

# With Ollama
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.base-url=http://localhost:11434/v1
# Configure server to use a specific model
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.chat-model.model-name=granite3.1-dense:2b
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.embedding-model.model-name=granite3.1-dense:2b

quarkus.langchain4j.openai.log-requests=true
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.log-responses=true
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.timeout=60s

%dev.quarkus.mailer.mock=false
----

Make sure your Quarkus Dev mode is still running. It should have reloaded with the new configuration.

Because we haven't configured the local email service, Quarkus will also have started a Dev Service to instantiate and configure a local email service for you (in dev mode only!).

You can check it running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
podman ps
----

And you should see something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                             NAMES
e4a1d5aae322  docker.io/testcontainers/ryuk:0.6.0  /bin/ryuk   34 seconds ago  Up 34 seconds  0.0.0.0:35965->8080/tcp                           testcontainers-ryuk-4cb568ec-9335-4e91-a6aa-60c5a631567a

----

Which means that you have an email service up and running.

== Invoke the endpoint

You can check your prompt implementation by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/email-me-a-poem[window=_blank]

You can also run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/email-me-a-poem
----

An example of output (will vary on each prompt execution):

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
I have composed a poem about Quarkus. I have sent it to you via email. Let me know if you need anything else
----

If you have a tool calling model configured, you can check your inbox for the actual email:

First, open the http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui[DevUI, window=_blank] and click on the Mailpit arrow.

Now you can see the email that was sent:
